# LearnPython
This repository is a collection of Python projects and exercises that I worked on while learning Python from scratch. The repository contains code snippets, challenges, and two major projects I created during my learning journey.

# Contents
Python Fundamentals: Various code snippets and exercises demonstrating key Python concepts, such as variables, data types, loops, functions, object-oriented programming, and more. Project: AI Talking Assistant: A simple AI-based voice assistant similar to Alexa. This project utilizes Python's speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries to interact with the user. It can perform basic tasks like opening applications, playing music, and answering questions.

# Projects
AI Talking Assistant This project is a voice-activated assistant that can perform simple tasks. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries in Python to understand user input and provide spoken responses.

# Features
Recognize speech input using the microphone. Respond to commands such as playing music, setting reminders, and fetching information from the web. Open apps and websites by voice command. Other Python Learning Projects As part of my learning journey, this repository also includes other smaller Python scripts that focus on different concepts, including: Basic algorithms Working with data structures Problem-solving exercises Learning Path Python Basics: I started by learning the basic syntax and concepts such as variables, functions, and control flow. Intermediate Python: I then explored topics such as object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and libraries. Advanced Python: Finally, I worked on projects involving libraries like speech_recognition and pyttsx3 for building interactive applications. Contributing Feel free to contribute by adding more Python-related projects or improving the existing code. I welcome contributions that enhance the projects or demonstrate new Python techniques.

# Thank You!
Thank you for checking out my repository! I hope these projects help others who are also learning Python or want to explore AI-related development.
